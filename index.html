Since the lockdown, we’ve seen TikTok’s popularity go through the roof! From a few million users in 2018 to a billion monthly active users in 2022, we can admit that TikTok has surprised us all.
At first, theTikTokhad a persistent reputation as a social media app for kids, well looks like the tables have turned! Today TikTok is recognized as a social media platform with huge potential. Instagram and YouTube were the initial popular networks for influencers, and Instagram is the social network that truly built the notion of social media marketing as its format was adapted to commercial content. However, with time, TikTok has gained users and created worldwide known trends, catching the attention of Instagram, YouTube, other influencers, and brands.
While the platform has seen its audience grow massively through time, TikTok has also bettered the app. There are longer videos, better hashtag quality, an evolving algorithm, a growing community, and finally, formats adapted to paid content and ads. All in all, this progression is favorable to the influencer marketing industry. Brands have better visibility when working with tiktokers and efficiently comply with TikTok’s commercial guidelines.
If you log into TikTok, you’ll find popular brands, luxury labels, pop stars, actors, and so on, in addition to the original content creators. As TikTok has raised the attention of many, big names have joined the community, and the snowball effect took over. With big brands, celebrities, and business owners entering the game, TikTok has gone through an upgrade. We’re not talking about small businesses partnering with micro-content creators anymore. From startups to multinational groups, any brand can boost their sales on TikTok. You just need two things: a fixed strategy with clear objectives and the right influencer that can reach these goals!
We have gone through the evolution of TikTok, from nano influencers starting on this video platform to celebrities joining the TikTok community. But who exactly are these famous personalities? That’s what we are about to find out!</p>
